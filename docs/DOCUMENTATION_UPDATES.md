## 🎯 Impact of Changes

### Before (Manual Setup)
```bash
# 5+ step process
1. Install Whisper.cpp manually
2. Set WHISPER_CPP_PATH environment variable
3. Build Docker image
4. Download models manually
5. Test installation
```

### After (Docker-First)
```bash
# 2-step process
1. make setup
2. make transcribe VIDEO=video.mp4 MODEL=base
```

### Benefits Achieved:

- ✅ **Simplified Setup**: 60% reduction in setup steps
- ✅ **Eliminated Dependencies**: No manual Whisper.cpp installation required
- ✅ **Improved Reliability**: No architecture mismatch issues
- ✅ **Better User Experience**: One-command setup with clear feedback
